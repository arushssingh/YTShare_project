Editors can upload videos directly to linked YouTube channels using unique access keys.

# YTShare - YouTube Video Uploader  

YTShare is a platform that simplifies YouTube video uploads for YouTubers and their editors. It enables secure authentication, direct video uploads via access keys, and efficient file management. Built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and YouTube API, it ensures a smooth and secure experience.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Secure Authentication** – JWT-based login and OAuth 2.0 for YouTube access  
- **YouTube API Integration** – Direct video uploads to linked channels  
- **Role-Based Access** – Editors upload videos using unique access keys  
- **File Management** – Multer middleware for handling uploads  
- **Performance Optimization** – Auto-scaling, caching, and efficient database queries  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **API:** YouTube Data API  

## 📌 How It Works  
1. **User Registration & Channel Linking**  
   - YouTubers sign up and link their YouTube accounts via OAuth 2.0.  
   - The system generates unique access keys.  

2. **Video Upload by Editors**  
   - Editors log in using access keys.  
   - Videos are uploaded directly to YouTube channels.  

3. **Security & Performance Enhancements**  
   - Secure authentication with JWT and bcrypt.  
   - Background jobs for efficient video processing.  
   - Optimized cloud deployment for scalability.  

## 📂 Setup & Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YTShare.git
   cd YTShare
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Configure environment variables:
   Set up .env file with required API keys and database credentials.
4. Start the server:
   npm start

📈 Project Workflow

- User Authentication & Authorization
- Uses JWT for secure user login and OAuth 2.0 for YouTube channel access.
- bcrypt is used for password hashing.
- YouTube API Integration
- Users link their YouTube channels via OAuth 2.0.
- The system generates unique access keys for editors to upload videos.
- File Upload & Management
- Multer middleware handles video uploads.
- Ensures data integrity and error handling for large files.
- Security Measures
- Password hashing with bcrypt.
- Access controls using JWT authentication and middleware-protected routes.
- Database security with separate tables for users, access keys, and video metadata.
- Performance Optimization
- Auto-scaling servers to handle traffic spikes.
- Minification, tree shaking, and lazy loading for frontend optimization.
- Database optimization using connection pooling and sharding.
